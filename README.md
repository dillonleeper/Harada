# Harada Open Window 64 — Personal Mastery Dashboard

This repository contains my custom **Open Window 64 grid**, inspired by the Harada Method and Shohei Ohtani’s goal-setting system.

The purpose of this project is to build a **daily training environment** that compounds my skills across:

- Creativity (art, design, storytelling)
- Technical leverage (AI, code, data)
- SaaS/business building (SellerIQ)
- Career systems
- Brand/audience development
- Health & energy
- Identity & discipline

The central goal:

> **Achieve financial independence through creativity + tech.**

## 🧠 What This App Does

- Renders a 3×3 Harada grid with:
  - 1 **central goal**
  - 8 **pillars**
  - 64 **repeatable mastery tasks**
- Allows you to **click tasks to mark them complete for the day**
- Automatically **resets daily**
- Tracks **lifetime completions** using `localStorage`
- Displays stats for:
  - Tasks completed today
  - Total completions per pillar
  - Overall lifetime volume

It’s intentionally simple — no backend, no frameworks, just a clean browser-based training tool designed for daily repetition and long-term mastery.
